Introduction
============

Welcome to PyAlgoTrade!
PyAlgoTrade is a Python library that I started with one simple goal in mind: Evaluate stock trading strategies.
That is, given a certain amount of historical data for one stock, I want to check how a certain stock trading strategy behaves.

Before we start, PyAlgoTrade was developed with Python 2.7 and depends on NumPy and SciPy, so you need to have those installed in order to use this library.
